/** SCKView is an abstract NSView subclass which implements common functionality for any
 * subclasses that display a collection of @c SCKEventView subviews provided by the
 * delegate of an associated @c SCKEventManager object. This base class provides:
 * - Basic date scope management via @c startDate, @c endDate and @c absoluteTimeInterval.
 * - Functional conversion between @c NSDate and @c SCKRelativeTimeLocation values, and
 *   also the @c relativeTimeLocationForPoint: which subclasses should override.
 * - Ability to get/set the coloring policy used to draw subviews' background.
 * - Basic event selection and deselection handling.
 * - Handling of double click on an empty space.
 * - Drag and drop feedback methods for SCKEventView class.
 * - Common event view (un)locking and relayout workflow.
